# cc-channel — voice-inbox × Claude Code `/channels`

MCP stdio server that bridges voice-inbox to a live Claude Code session via the
[channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference) contract.

**Architecture (phase 1–3):**

```
[PWA mic / curl]
    ↓ POST /channels/push {project, text}
[voice-inbox :8765]  ← single HTTP entry
    ↓ in-memory queue per project
[channel.ts subprocess] long-poll GET /channels/pull?project=X
    ↓ stdio notification
[CC session X]
    ↓ speak tool call  ← NEW in phase 3
[channel.ts] POST /channels/reply
    ↓
[voice-inbox TTS worker]  → speaker 🔊
```

One voice-inbox instance, N channel subprocesses (one per running CC session).
The channel server has no HTTP listener of its own — it pulls from voice-inbox's
`/channels/pull` endpoint keyed by project name (basename of its cwd).

The `speak` tool lets Claude push short audio replies back (confirmations, summaries,
1-2 sentence answers); longer responses stay in the terminal.

## Requirements

- Claude Code v2.1.80+ (`claude --version`)
- Bun (`bun --version`)
- claude.ai login (not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) — channels requirement
- voice-inbox running on `http://127.0.0.1:8765` (default)

## Install

```bash
cd cc-channel
bun install
```

## Wire it in

Add voice-inbox to your user-level `~/.claude.json` so every project picks it up:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voice-inbox": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/voice-inbox/cc-channel/channel.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Per-project: drop `.mcp.json.example` (rewritten with your absolute path) as `.mcp.json`.

## Run

Start voice-inbox first (separate terminal), then start CC with channels:

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:voice-inbox
```

At startup the channel subprocess registers itself with voice-inbox under the
project name `basename(cwd)` (e.g. `ozebud`) and begins long-polling.

## Smoke test

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/channels/push \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"project": "ozebud", "text": "list files in this directory"}'
```

Expected: the CC session for project `ozebud` receives
`<channel source="voice-inbox" ...>list files...</channel>` and Claude reacts.

Other useful endpoints:
- `GET /channels/active` — lists active projects (PWA dropdown source)
- `GET /channels/pull?project=X&timeout=30` — what channel.ts polls
- `POST /channels/register` — what channel.ts calls on startup + every 10s
- `POST /channels/reply {project, text}` — what the `speak` tool calls; enqueues TTS

## Reply tool (`speak`)

When a channel message arrives, Claude may call the `speak` tool to reply with
a short spoken confirmation. Configured via `channels.archive_replies` in
`config.yaml`:
- `true` (default) — each reply also archived to DB so it shows up in `/status`
- `false` — TTS only, ephemeral

## Permission relay (`claude/channel/permission`)

When Claude Code opens a tool-use approval dialog (Bash, Write, Edit…), the
channel server forwards the prompt to voice-inbox, which announces it over TTS
and waits for the user's verdict. The verdict goes back to CC and the dialog
resolves in either direction (local terminal `y/n` still works — whichever
answer arrives first wins).

TTS announce template (Polish):
> "Claude w {project} chce uruchomic {tool_name}: {description}. Powiedz 'tak tak tak' aby zaakceptowac, 'nie nie nie' aby odrzucic."

Endpoints:
- `POST /channels/permissions/request` — channel.ts inserts pending + triggers TTS
- `GET /channels/permissions/pending[?project=X]` — inspection / PWA banner
- `POST /channels/permissions/respond {project, behavior, request_id?}` — resolves (oldest pending if no `request_id`)
- `GET /channels/permissions/poll?project=X&timeout=30` — channel.ts long-polls verdicts
- `GET /channels/permissions/log?limit=100` — resolved history (for observing response latency)

Config:
- `channels.archive_permissions` — log request + response to DB (default `true`)
- `channels.permissions_language` — `pl` or `en` for TTS announce (default `pl`)

## Environment

- `VOICE_INBOX_URL` — voice-inbox base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`)
- `VOICE_INBOX_CHANNEL_PROJECT` — override project name (default `basename(cwd)`)
- `VOICE_INBOX_PULL_TIMEOUT` — long-poll timeout seconds (default `30`)

## Troubleshooting

- `/mcp` in CC session shows channel status. "Failed to connect" → check stderr
  in `~/.claude/debug/<session-id>.txt` for Bun errors.
- Channel server logs to stderr (`[cc-channel:project] ...`); stdin/stdout are
  reserved for MCP JSON-RPC.
- If voice-inbox is down when CC starts, the channel server retries on 2s backoff
  and registers as soon as voice-inbox comes up.
